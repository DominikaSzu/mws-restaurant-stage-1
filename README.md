#### _Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Restaurant Reviews Project_

### Specification

The application lets the user control the restaurants in the neighbourhood. On the main page, the user can use the filters to indicate the type of the restaurant he is looking for and then go to the detailed page of the local that interests him. 
On the detailed restaurant's page, the user can control where the restaurant is, hours and the reviews left by other customers. 
The application is accessible for the screen reader users.
It also has a service worker added to offer an offline experience.
The main page and the detailed may be reviewed in all types of devices.

### Code Dependencies

This application is built with the base code provided by the Udacity and the following code dependencies:

1.Google Maps
2. Mapbox
3. Google Normalize-CSS

### How to start the application

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
